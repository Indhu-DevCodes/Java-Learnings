<h3 id="java_01">☕ What is Java?</h3>

**Java** is a **programming language** used to create software like **apps, games, and websites**.

* 🖥️ It helps computers understand **what to do**
* 📱 Used in mobile apps (especially Android)
* 🌍 Works on many devices using the same code
  *(“Write once, run anywhere”)*

**In simple words:**
👉 Java tells computers how to work, just like giving them instructions.


<h3 id="java_02">🌍 Why is Java platform independent?</h3>

**Java is a platform-independent language**, which means it can be used to develop **end-to-end mobile or desktop applications** that run on **different servers and operating systems**.

* 🧩 Java code is first changed into **bytecode**
* ⚙️ This bytecode runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
* 💻📱 Each device has its own JVM, so the **same Java program works everywhere**
* ☕ Java Programming Language is popular due to its “write once, run anywhere” functionality.

**Simple explanation:**
👉 Java runs on any system because it uses **JVM as a helper**, so you don’t need to rewrite the program for different computers.
